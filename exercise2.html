            Cardiacs are an English rock band formed in Kingston upon Thames in 1977. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Tim Smith and his brother bassist Jim Smith,
            the group have cycled through over a dozen keyboardists, percussionists and saxophone players. They are noted for their complex, varied and intense compositional 
            style and for their eccentric, theatrical stage shows. Hailed as an influence by bands as diverse as Blur, Faith No More and Napalm Death, their sound 
            incorporated elements of classical music and post-punk in innovative ways; the band explored music styles ranging from circus music and nursery rhymes to 
            psychedelia and experimental rock. Their music maintains a cult following and continues to influence modern avant-garde metal culture.

            Cardiacs' music is noted for balancing the attack and 'raw energy' of punk rock with the intricacies and technical cleverness of early British progressive rock. 
            The band also incorporates elements of other musical forms such as ska, mediaeval music, folk music, heavy metal, hymns and corporate anthems. The music magazine 
            Organ once commented that "one Cardiacs song contains more ideas than most other musicians' entire careers."
